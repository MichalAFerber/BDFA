<p>Thank you for your interest in <b>Buy Direct From Authors</b>. This is a project created by USA Today bestselling author Rebecca Hefner.</p>

<p>*You can click here to create an author account and list your direct store on <a asp-area="" asp-page="/Login">BuyDirectFromAuthors.com</a>. <b><i>However we suggest you read ALL of the FAQs and Terms and Conditions below before signing up.</i></b> Thank you!</p>

<p>Rebecca is the admin of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/marketingaudiobookswide" target="_blank">Marketing Audiobooks Wide</a> Facebook group and organizes the <a href="https://romanceaudiobookworms.com/" target="_blank">Stuff Your Earbuds</a> promo events and the <a href="https://indieaudiobookdeals.com/" target="_blank">Indie Audiobook Deals</a> promos.</p>

<p>Not only is Rebecca a huge proponent of having her books widely available in all platforms, but she firmly believes <b>direct selling is the future</b>. Direct selling allows authors to control all aspects of their business and not have to give a royalty to retailers.</p>

<p>Rebecca has two direct stores for her various author names, one on Shopify and one on Payhip, so she’s well-versed in direct selling.</p>

<p>The most important thing for direct selling once you have your store ready to receive traffic is <b>how and where to generate the traffic</b>. Traffic can be generated by ads, signing up for promos and paid newsletters that accept direct store links, and other ways.</p>

<p>However, ads can be costly for authors. <a href="https://buydirectfromauthors.com/">Buy Direct From Authors</a> was created to help drive traffic to authors’ stores. It’s a directory for authors’ direct stores, similar to Yelp for restaurants and businesses, <b><i>that creates a centralized listing site that any reader can access</i></b>.</p>

<p>Readers are able to access the Buy Direct From Authors directory and search by keywords to find the authors they wish to read. As more authors list their stores on the directory and spread the word, hopefully this will lead to more organic traffic for all the authors listed.</p>

<p>Often, readers post on social media asking where and how they can buy directly from authors. Now, there will be a quick and easy answer: <b><i>“Check out BuyDirectFromAuthors.com. It’s a site that lists authors who sell directly.”</i></b></p>

<p>More questions are answered below and if you have further questions, please feel free to email <a href="mailto:admin@buydirectfromauthors.com">admin@buydirectfromauthors.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>Thank you and I look forward to growing together!</b> - Rebecca</p>
